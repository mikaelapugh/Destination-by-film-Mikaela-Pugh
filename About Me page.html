            <p>My name is Mikaela Pugh. I am a 20-year-old University student.<br>I love to travel and experience different locations. Everywhere I go I find that I need to research about the place to find out what to do. However, I never seem to be able to find personal experiences for each place.<br>I decided to create this blog to fill a space that accounts for information about the destination as well as my own personal experiences there.<br>I love to photograph all my trips. Using a film camera is exciting to me because the anticipation of waiting for film to develop is like experiencing the trip all over again.</p>
