            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The Southern Highlands, in New South Wales, is the perfect escape to the countryside. Although it offers a cooler climate, there is nothing like the scenery in the Southern Highlands. Each village/town is unique for different reasons. Thereâ€™s Bowral, Mittagong, Moss Vale, Burradoo, Exeter, Bundanoon, and more which each have something to offer. Some of the activities available include bush walking, wine tasting, shopping, golf, horse riding, and lookout hunting. It holds historical value in Australia, especially the town of Berrima. It is famous for its pies (Gumnut Patisserie is the best) and its Tulip Time festival each spring. The Southern Highlands is a must visit for the perfect relaxing escape.</p>

            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>My experience in the Southern Highlands is different than many because I grew up here. I have experienced just about everything that the Southern Highlands has to offer, and loved every bit of it. Some of my favourite things to do as a child was to go bike riding on the Bong Bong bike track, go to Empire Cinema, ten-pin bowling, and playing in the many parks and fields. As I grew up, I learnt to appreciate other parts of the Southern Highlands, such as watching the sunset at different lookouts (Oxley Hill is my favourite lookout that shows the whole of Bowral), going for long drives, going wine tasting and pub crawling, Bush walking, and truly enjoying each restaurant. Fitzroy Falls National Park and The Gib are two of the best bush walks. The Robertson Pub, the Royal Hotel, Bistro Officina, Briars Hotel, and the Imperial Hotel are all great spots for a good dinner and drink. For wine tasting I highly recommend Bendooley Estate and Centennial Vineyards. The Southern Highlands gives the best countryside experience for any type of traveller.</p>
