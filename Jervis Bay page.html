            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Jervis Bay is one of the most beautiful locations in New South Wales. It entertains so many different activities for visitors to do. If the perfectly white sand and crystal blue water isnâ€™t enough, there are endless numbers of activities for all people to enjoy. These include, wine tasting, water sports, whale watching, and so much more. It is surrounded by many key attractions of New South Wales giving options for visitors. While the beaches within the bay are calm with minimal waves, surrounding beaches, such as Cave Beach, in the National park are a must (especially for surfers). Camp grounds, motels and many Airbnb beach houses are available to suit any holiday style.</p>

            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>I have been going to Jervis Bay since I was young with my family. It holds some of my fondest memories. Most trips we rent an <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/jervis-bay-territory-australia/stays">Airbnb</a> to have the whole space to ourselves, other times we have camped at <a href="https://jervisbayholidaypark.com.au">Jervis Bay Holiday Park</a>. Spending days on the beach, bike riding around the neighbourhoods and fun boat days. Now, I go on an annual trip with my friends. During the day we go swimming at the beach, go on bush walks, and driving to explore nearby beaches (our favourite is Hyams Beach). At night, we enjoy the pastel sunsets, go for a drink and dinner at the Huskisson Pub, or just hang around at our Airbnb backyard. The reason we go back to Jervis Bay so often is because of the memories it holds and the luxury to relax and do our own thing.</p>
