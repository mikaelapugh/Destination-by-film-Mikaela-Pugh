            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Kiama is a beautiful coastal town in New South Wales. It boasts beautiful beaches, the worldâ€™s largest blowhole, some of the best ocean pools, scenic coastal walks, and great cafes and restaurants. It is the perfect destination for beach holidays, with so much to offer not only within Kiama but also surrounding towns. The coastal walk stretches along 20km of the seaside. The farmers markets provide fresh food and great products to shop and experience. There are many beaches to discover and enjoy, making it a must visit location. This destination is pet and family friendly for all to enjoy.</p>
            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>I have been to Kiama beach many times. Each for different reasons and activities. My first time at Kiama was a family trip. We stayed in a <a href="https://kiama.com.au/stay/holiday-houses">Holiday Home</a> and went to the beach almost every day. It was where I first learnt to surf at a local surf school (there are plenty to choose from). Playing beach cricket and visiting the light house are some of my fondest memories here. The farmers market was always a fun day trying new foods. Later visits in my life were to take my dog to Bombo Beach for a swim on hot summer days, enjoying the art trail with my family, and going on holidays with my friends. I highly recommend spending a day at Jambaroo Action Park, just a short drive away. Kiama has so much to offer for all visitors and is the perfect summer spot.</p>
