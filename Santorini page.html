            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Santorini is a popular Greek destination. Santorini has so much to offer with many different scenes to take in. It is unique to the other islands that Greece has to offer due to its dramatic rocky landscape and beautiful one-of-a-kind views. It was formed as a result of a volcanic eruption, creating unique red and black beaches. Much of the accommodation in Santorini features beautiful infinity pools, and whitewashed buildings. Oia and Thira boasts some of the worlds best sun sets to view. The inner parts of the island provide vineyards that produce spectacular wines. It is one of the romantic destinations in the world, but is also suitable for all people. The culture in Santorini is an experience like no other, with beautiful churches and traditional architecture.</p>

            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>After a night stay in Athens, a I took an early morning boat, along with a group of my friends, to the beautiful sights of Santorini. Once we arrived at the port, we took a unique bus trip up the steep cliff to get to the top of Santorini. Our <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/santorini-greece/stays">Airbnb</a> was in Mesaria, our home base for our 4 night stay. We were lucky to get to experience a Cave House. On our first day we explored Mesaria, trying the different restaurants and walking along the paths that lead us to a beautiful lookout for sunset. The next day, we took a bus into Thira and walked through the traditional buildings, alleyways and shops. This was a really insightful experience to the Greek Culture and way of life. The next day we took a bus to Red Beach, one of the volcanic beaches. We spent most of our morning here enjoying the crystal clear water. After our swim we took a bus to Oia to enjoy a dinner and the most spectacular sunset we had all ever seen. After our four night stay, we took another ferry to Mykonos. It was an unforgettable trip. </p>
