            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Dubrovnik is a unique location in Croatia. It boasts culture, history and a beautiful scenery with plenty to experience. Dubrovnik is recognised for its outstanding medieval architecture and fortified Old Town. It is structured by old buildings, walls, forts and the Rector’s Palace, which now operates as a historical building. The crystal clear pebble beaches are a must visit for a fun day out, with cliff and rock jumping and kayaking. Views over the town are like no other and give a historical insight to the town. Dubrovnik is a place suitable for all people, but especially those interested in medieval history.</p>

            <h2>My Experience</h2>
            <p>After spending a week sailing around Croatia on <a href="https://sailweekcroatia.com">Sail week</a>, my friends and I took a bus down to Dubrovnik to spend 3 nights there. We rented an <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/dubrovnik-croatia/stays">Airbnb</a> overlooking Dubrovnik which gave us the most incredible sunsets. During our first day, we walked down the hill to explore the Stadun, the main thoroughfare through the Old Town. Later we walked along the Dubrovnik Walls to take in the town at a closer view. The next day we spend at Beach Šulić where we spent the day swimming and jumping of rocks. On our final day, we walked through the streets of the town and went for a final swim before getting on our flight. Each night we ate at different restaurants and enjoyed the extraordinary food that the town has to offer. Visiting Dubrovnik is definitely an experience worth having.</p>
