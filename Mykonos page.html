            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Mykonos is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Greece, an island in the centre of the Cyclades island group. Mykonos is built with traditional architecture of whitewashed buildings, stone alleyways and accents of blue. It is a destination suitable for all people, including families, young adults, and elderly people. There is something for everyone to enjoy. Chora (Mykonos Town) is the main town of Mykonos with luxurious restaurants, shops, bars and clubs. Paraga Beach, Paradise Beach, Psarrou Beach, and more located on the south coast of the island are the central location for the incredible, lively night life. The dreamy beaches that outline the island are unique for their deep blue crystal waters and pebbly sand. From its traditional architecture to incredible night life to serene beaches, everything about Mykonos makes it a must visit destination.

            <h2>My experience</h2>
            <p>I spent a week in Mykonos with some of my closest friends. It was a one in a lifetime experience. After my week in Santorini, we travelled by boat to Mykonos. Arriving at the port, we took a bus to get us to where we were staying for our first few nights, <a href="https://www.mycamp.gr">Paraga Beach hostel</a>. The accommodation here was set up like bunker tents which was a unique experience in itself. We spent our days here at the beach, and our nights exploring the clubs at paradise beach, Club Paradiso being our favourite. It was an eventful experience making new friends from all over the world along the way. After 3 nights in Paraga, we took a bus to Mykonos Town where we were greeted by our welcoming Airbnb host. After settling in our traditional Mykonos <a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/mykonos-greece/stays">Airbnb</a>, we set out to explore the alley ways gathering souvenirs and groceries along the way. Each day we ate Greek Gyros for every single meal. This part of our trip was a more cultural experience of the Greek lifestyle. It was also a more relaxing part of our trip where we spent our days exploring different beaches, watched the beautiful sunsets, experienced different restaurants and enjoyed night walks through the alleys. Having both experiences in Mykonos made our trip that much more memorable.</p>
